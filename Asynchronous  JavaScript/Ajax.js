/*

With Ajax, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behaviour of the existing page. 

We don't use data in XML format anymore. We use JSON now. 

We have 3 most common ways to create and send request to server: 

1. xmlHTTPRequest (old way of doing)
2. Fetch API (new way of doing)
3. AXIOS (this is third party library)

Ajax allows webpages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging small amounts of data with the server behind the scenes. This means that parts of a webpage can be updated without having to reload the entire page. 

Asynchronous: AJAX allows for asynchronous communication, meanin gthe browser can send and receive data from a server in the background without interfering with the display and behaviour of the existing page. 

JavaScript: AJAX uses javascript to send requests to the server and to process the server's response. 

XML: Although the name includes XML, in modern applications, the data exchanged with the server is often in JSON format rather than XML.
