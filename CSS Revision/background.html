    <h1>Transparent Boxes</h1>
    <p>When using the opacity property to add transparency to the background of an element, all of its child elements become transparent as well. This can make the text inside a fully transparent element hard to read: </p>

    <div class="first">
        <h1>Opacity 0.1</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="second">
        <h1>Opacity 0.3</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="third">
        <h1>Opacity 0.6</h1>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>Opacity 1 (default) </h1>
    </div>
